Revision system is as follows:
vX.Y.Z

Where X is the GCS compatibility number, and should not change unless GCS gets a major update.

Y is the Major revision number, and should be updated when a new campaign is started and a character is made for that, or when a large overhaul is made to a character in a long-form campaign.

Z is the Minor revision number, and should be updated at the end of every campaign session with the changes that come with the character. This has the added benefit of being a session count.


One-shot characters and characters that are not in use are rarely, if ever, worthy of a revision.
